My programming journey began in 2009 during school, when I recreated the Google homepage using HTML and CSS. I also built small applications out of curiosity, not realizing this spark would shape my future.

After a long break, I returned to coding and everything clicked — programming became my true passion. I relearned the basics, explored PHP, and started building real applications, reminding me how naturally development comes to me.

Today, I work with Node.js, Express, MySQL, and React.js, building full-stack applications end-to-end. I enjoy every part of the process, from crafting clean UIs to designing APIs and structuring databases.

I’m currently a Front-End Developer, combining strong UI/UX skills with modern engineering practices to create scalable, user-focused experiences. Outside work, I continue exploring full-stack development out of pure passion.

Full-stack development isn’t just my profession it’s something I genuinely love creating for my own ideas and projects.
